        "Al Mughsayl Beach (also spelt 'Mughsail') can be found in southern Oman in the city of Salalah. Unlike Al Qurum beach, it is relatively untouched with fewer crowds and less commercial activity. In the summers, it's a wonderful place for sunbathing. In the monsoons, the waves are known to explode through blowholes in the partially-collapsed caves just off the beach. From the cliffs, you can get a pretty view looking towards the Yemen border. Across the beach's 7 kilometres coastline, you can find flora such as banana trees and coconut grooves that give it a laid-back vibe. Close to this beach is a twisting road repeating into itself called 'Furious Road' for thrill seekers.",
